NEW: You can now have multiple notes!

A simple notes extension, right in your chrome browser! Easily copy around a few words to and from different chrome windows and other apps.

* Ad-free

Chrome Notes remembers your notes and mode, even after closing chrome or restarting your computer! Notes are stored in local storage, so nobody else will ever see them, not us, and not Google.

Use Chrome Notes as an extra clipboard, or to speak some text out-loud.

Features:
* Resizable notepad
* Shortcut buttons for cut, copy, paste, and select all
* Normal keyboard shortcuts work too
* Save as a .txt file
* Open in new window
* Speak selected text outloud
